Google Styled Map Integration + Google Prompt to Speak, Transparent Toolbar Demo

This App is a prototype for presenting women's safety.
What it does?
The app focuses on detecting danger using noise, speech or keywords using the MIC of the deivce.
Currently the Danger Detection is caught using only Amplitude in the sound.
We are looking forward to connect the app to a wearable which records heartbeats. Combining Factors like amplitude, pitch, frequency for accurate detection and then applying ML algorithms to detect danger is our future prospect.
